In this project, I aimed to apply three variations of Neural Networks, Simple Neural Networks (NNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), for the sentiment analysis of the movie reviews.

The Data set utilized for this project is IMDB 50K reviews, a standard data set for sentiment analysis. The data set is composed of 50,000 reviews of users on the IMDB website, and their sentiment is marked as “positive” or “negative.” The allocation of the reviews an their labels is as follows:

*Word cloud of positive reviews:*

*Word cloud of negative reviews:*

The word count distribution of the negative and positive reviews:
